# league_feasibility

**league_feasibility** is an interactive tool that uses Linear Programming and AI to determine whether a football team can still reach a specific league position, given current standings, remaining fixtures, and user-defined constraints.

## Features

- **Feasibility Solver:** Checks if a team can still finish in a target position (e.g., top 4, avoid relegation).
- **AI-Powered Scenario Parsing:** Converts natural language scenarios into structured constraints using GPT (e.g., "Can Manchester United still finish top 8 if they lose to Arsenal?")
- **Post-Solution Analysis:** Explains the key fixtures and outcomes (not just for the target team) that enable or block the scenario.
